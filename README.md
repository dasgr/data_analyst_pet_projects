A collection of different tasks of DA's routine

## A/B-test results EDA and calculation

A DS department of some foodtech company made an improvement of main page sorting using ML-algorithm. The main page is the place where the user can choose the restaurant or other provider. An algorithm puts providers with higher average amount at the top of the page. That is why the change in sorting of the main page may cause an uplift in the average amount of check among all orders. The change of sorting is evaluated thorugh A/B-test with users splitted into two groups:
1. test_group = A - control group with default main page sorting
2. test_group = B - test group with main page sorting by ML-algorithm

### The final task is:
1. to choose key metrics to evaluate the results of a/b-test
2. to check the statistical significane of results
3. to create an explicit inerpretation of the test's results 
4. to draw cocnlusions and recommendations for the bussiness unit based on previous points
